title: "Broken Streak"
---

I broke my writing streak for 4 days. I was travelling over the weekend and recovering from jet lag. Let's see if I break it again when travel back. I'm trying to maintain my other habits. Watching lectures on LinkedIn Learning is the easiest. Checking financials of public companies is moderate while doing squats is more difficult.

I started reading "Acts of God" by Kanan Gill. It's quite funny. He cracks little jokes in almost every sentence. Also, this book is not available on US Kindle store. Good for me. It's quite cheap on Indian Kindle store, about $2.

I am also reading the book by Kishore Biyani. He writes about his journey in the Indian retail market. Maybe one day, I will write reviews of all the books I read.

title: To schedule or not to schedule
---

I read the [productivity guide](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html) by Marc Andreesen where he mentioned getting rid of scheduled meetings, events, conferences. It is an interesting idea where I don't make any commitment for a future day and do what I feel is the most important at the moment. It would avoid any interruptions and help me getting in the "flow". I can try blocking certain days of the week to try it out and if it works, I can extend it to all days.

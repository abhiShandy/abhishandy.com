title: Range of an EV
---

I drove an EV for 3 years and stopped. Why did I stop? My wife has a gas car and it is good enough and even better in one aspect -- range. Gas cars generally have a range of more than 400 miles while the range of an EV is not more than 300 miles. In my opinion, this is a major factor in EV adoption. As a driver, I don't want to plan my road trips around charging / refuelling, I want to charge / refuel just when it's time to do so. Just like we drink water when we are thirsty and not plan our day around refilling ourselves.

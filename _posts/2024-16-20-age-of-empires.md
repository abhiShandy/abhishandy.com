title: "Age of Empires"

I played Age of Empires with my friends yesterday. We have been playing as a team against bots at increasing difficulty. Yesterday, we played 3v3 against bots at moderate difficulty. We won. What worked for us is that we attacked first. We didn't lose any buildings, so our dying troops were being replaced after each wave. My navy also defended my allies against enemy's navy.

In the second game, we played 3v5 against bots at standard difficulty. This was mainly for practice and exchanging tips and tricks with my friends. Troops created from my castle were quite powerful. I am thinking of focusing more on castle building and castle upgrades in my next game.

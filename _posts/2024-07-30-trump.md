Trump is expected to become the next POTUS. How does that affect me?

I work in the EV charging industry. Here are my guesses:
1. He might cancel the NEVI program to setup charging stations since they haven't shown any impact.
2. He might cancel the tax incentives to buy electric vehicles which might slow down the EV purchase till the manufacturers figure out another way to attract buyers.
3. He might promote energy production through nuclear, thermal and hydro power plants which can lead to cheaper electricity. That cheap electricity might reduce running cost of EV.
4. He might make oil production and transport even easier which might reduce the gas prices, making it competitive to electricity prices.

Overall, I think Trump presidency will be a mixed bag for electric vehicle industry and we can't be sure of anything until he announces policy changes. Personally, I am inclined on buying an EV right now with the hope that the tax incentives will go away next year and electricity prices will stay steady or go down from next year.

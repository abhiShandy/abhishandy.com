I have been watching this TV show for last few weeks. It shows how ranchers live and how they are misunderstood by city folks.

Ranchers raise cattle and horses and hunt animals on their land. They never want to sell their land, and want to keep it for future generations. This long term persepective leads them to maintain their land much better than short-sighted government officials and environmental activists.

However, the future generations of these ranch owners are losing interest in the ranch and looking to move out. These creates an opportunity for corporates to buy that ranch and convert them into a concrete jungle.

What is the future implication of that? Will national parks be the only untouchable parts of the country? Will everything else be converted to concrete cities?

I tried creating a 15 second video using PowerPoint and a music track. It took me around an hour. I guess my speed will improve as I practice and create videos regularly. I am going to try a different software today, iMovie. Let's see if it's easier to use.

If not, I will try Adobe Animate which is an expensive software.

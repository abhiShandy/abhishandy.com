I am feeling helpless with my immigration status in the USA. Either I have to depend on my employer or establish a track record of my talents and outstanding skills. There is a third way, which is often dismissed as unreachable. The Immigrant Investor Program (EB-5) encourages investments from immigrants to create jobs and boost the economy.

This program requires investment of around 1 million USD. I don't have that kind of money. How can I make it? Here are my options:
1. Win a lottery
2. Make a killing while trading stocks and its derivatives
3. Bet on sports and other events
4. Earn a high salary and equity from my employer
5. Setup a business and make money

Out of these options, I am most attracted to option 2 and 5. My deadline to make 1 million USD is 2025 (soft) and 2028 (hard). I hope I can make it in time.

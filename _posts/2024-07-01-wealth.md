I want to be rich. Rich enough to travel anywhere, anytime comfortably. Rich enough make live comfortably wherever I want. Rich enough to buy nice things whenever I want.

How can I get rich?
1. I can write code. Maybe I solve people's problems, and get paid for it.
2. I can read. Maybe I can proof read drafts of books and papers, and get paid for it.
3. I love watching movies and TV shows. Maybe I can praise/criticize them for a fee.
4. I love learning something new. Maybe I can teach whatever I learn.

I don't know which of these four options I should choose. Maybe I try one of them for a month to find out how much I enjoy it.

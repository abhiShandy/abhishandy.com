I would like to quit working full-time. Instead, I would like to work in bursts. How can I do that?

I have been exploring options which can maintain my lifestyle.

## Option 1: Earn a lot of money and put it in high yield savings account

At the current interest rate of 4.25%, I would need around almost $300k to earn $1000 in monthly interest.

## Option 2: Buy a house and earn rental income

If I buy a $300k house in a city where the price-to-rent ratio is below 25, I can earn more than the previous option.

## Option 3: Invest in stock market using ETFs

If I invest $300k in ETFs, it must grow at an average rate of 4.5% to be better than the first option. In that case, I can withdraw $12k every year and still get some compounding growth.

However, I do not have $300k lying in my bank account. So, I have to figure out that much before I can quit working full-time.
